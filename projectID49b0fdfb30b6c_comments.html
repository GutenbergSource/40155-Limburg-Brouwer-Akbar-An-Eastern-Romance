<HTML><BODY>In my series of English translations of original Dutch works, this is a nineteenth century novel situated at Akbar's (The Great Mogul of India) court, complete with an interesting introduction Clements S. Markham. (That would actually be worthwhile to translate to Dutch.)

<p>The text should straightforward, so have fun.

<p>The Dutch version is etext no <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6712">6712</a>.

<p>Added 30 Sep 2009: Please do not write-out the pound symbol £ in this book, but let it stand as £. (It occurs a lot in the publisher's catalog that follows the main text.)</BODY></HTML>
